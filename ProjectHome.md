# METAR2db #

## Introduction ##

This script gets [METAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR) weather data from the [tubes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes) of [Interweb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interweb), parses it, and stores it in a relational database for future use.

## Implementation ##

It is implemented in [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) using [Geo::METAR](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/perl/METAR/) and [DBI](http://dbi.perl.org/) libraries.

## Getting started ##

Before the first official release, if you want to see for yourself how the software does (not) work, you can checkout the code from SVN and then read more information from QuickStart.
